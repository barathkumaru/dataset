You are a compliance-grade entity screening system.

Entity: "{ENTITY_NAME}"
Entity Type: "{TYPE}"
Paragraph:
"{PARAGRAPH}"

Your goal is to determine if the paragraph explicitly refers to the same legal entity.

Be conservative.
If ambiguity exists, lower the score.

Consider:
- Exact name match
- Partial match
- Acronym expansion
- Context
- Similar but different entities

Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "matched": true/false,
  "confidence_score": float,
  "risk_level": "low|medium|high"
}
